# Snapshot System

Identity file snapshots are automatic backups that protect against accidental data loss. They capture the state of identity files before changes are applied.

## When Snapshots Are Created

| Trigger | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Automatic** | Before any identity file replacement via `identity_write` or `sync_push` |
| **Scheduled** | During scheduled sync operations |
| **Manual** | On-demand via the `snapshot_create` MCP tool or through the Psycheros UI |

## Storage

Snapshots are stored in `data/.snapshots/` organized by identity category:

```
data/.snapshots/
├── self/
├── user/
├── relationship/
└── custom/
```

Each snapshot file includes metadata headers with:
- **Timestamp** — when the snapshot was created
- **Reason** — what triggered the snapshot (write, sync, manual)
- **Source** — which embodiment or action caused the change

Filenames follow the pattern: `filename_YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS-NNNZ.md`

## Retention

Snapshots are automatically cleaned up after the configured retention period.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `ENTITY_CORE_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION_DAYS` | `30` | Days to retain snapshots before cleanup |

Cleanup runs as a Deno cron job. Significant or manually-flagged snapshots can be excluded from automatic cleanup.

## Restoring

Snapshots can be restored through two methods:

1. **MCP Tool** — Use `snapshot_restore` to restore identity files from a specific snapshot
2. **Psycheros UI** — Navigate to Settings → Core Prompts → Snapshots tab

The restore process:
1. List available snapshots via `snapshot_list` (includes metadata for each)
2. Inspect a specific snapshot via `snapshot_get` to review its contents
3. Restore via `snapshot_restore` which replaces the current identity file with the snapshot version

A new snapshot is automatically created before any restore operation, so restores are always reversible.
