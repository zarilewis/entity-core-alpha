# Security Audit

Status: **Complete** — reviewed for homelab deployment behind Authelia.

## Threat Model

entity-core runs as a subprocess spawned by Psycheros, communicating over stdio (MCP protocol). It has no HTTP server and no direct network exposure. The primary attack vector is malicious MCP tool calls — either from a compromised Psycheros instance or from LLM prompt injection causing the entity to call tools with crafted arguments.

## Critical Fix: Path Traversal in Identity Tools

**Severity:** Critical
**Location:** `src/tools/identity.ts:25-71`

The `filename` field in 5 identity tool schemas accepted any string, allowing `../../.env.md` to escape the data directory. This was the highest-severity finding across both repos.

**Fix:** Created shared `SafeFilenameSchema` with regex `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+\.md$/` — enforces alphanumeric filenames at the Zod schema level. Applied to all 5 schemas (`IdentityWriteSchema`, `IdentityAppendSchema`, `IdentityPrependSchema`, `IdentityUpdateSectionSchema`, `IdentityDeleteCustomSchema`). Inline handler checks remain as defense-in-depth.

**Important for future development:** Any new identity tools that accept filenames MUST use `SafeFilenameSchema`. This is the primary security boundary in the codebase.

## Confirmed Safe Patterns

- **SQL injection**: All queries in `src/graph/store.ts` use `?` placeholders — no string concatenation
- **LIKE clauses**: User input wrapped as parameters, not string interpolation
- **Memory tool inputs**: `granularity` is Zod enum-validated; `date` uses strict regex
- **Identity category**: Zod enum restricts to `self|user|relationship|custom`
- **Snapshot operations**: Use safe path construction from validated inputs
