# Sync Protocol & Memory System

The sync protocol and memory system are tightly coupled — embodiments sync memories with instance tagging, and the memory hierarchy consolidates them over time. This document covers both systems.

## Sync Protocol

Embodiments sync with entity-core using a batch sync model:

1. **Startup**: Embodiment pulls all identity files and memories via `sync_pull`
2. **Operation**: Works with local cache, queues changes
3. **Periodic**: Pushes queued changes via `sync_push` (default: every 5 minutes)
4. **Shutdown**: Final sync before disconnecting

### Conflict Resolution

- **Identity files**: Last-write-wins with instance priority tiebreaker
- **Memories**: Last-write-wins (incoming version overwrites). Daily memories use instance-scoped filenames (`YYYY-MM-DD_instance.md`), so each instance owns its file exclusively — conflicts cannot occur. For other granularities (weekly/monthly/yearly/significant), the incoming push is authoritative.
- **Memory edits**: The `memory/update` tool intentionally overwrites content (no merge). This is for user-initiated corrections from the Memories UI. The `editedBy` field and version bump distinguish edits from sync-generated content.

### Instance Tagging

Memory entries are tagged with:
- `sourceInstance` — which embodiment created the memory (in entry metadata)
- `participatingInstances` — other embodiments involved in the conversation
- Inline `[via:instanceId]` tag on each bullet point in memory content, alongside `[chat:id]`

This metadata enables instance-aware retrieval during memory search and lets the entity identify the source of individual memories when multiple embodiments contribute to the same file.

### Vector Clocks

Distributed versioning uses vector clocks (`src/sync/versioning.ts`) to track causality across embodiments. Each embodiment maintains its own clock, and conflicts are detected when clocks are concurrent (neither dominates the other).

## Memory Hierarchy

Memories are organized hierarchically. All memories are **permanently retained** — consolidation tiers produce supplementary summaries, not replacements.

```
daily → weekly → monthly → yearly
```

| Granularity | Description | Status |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| **Daily** | Auto-generated conversation summaries | Created during conversations (by embodiments) |
| **Weekly** | Consolidated from daily | Startup catch-up + cron (Sunday 5 AM) + `memory_consolidate` tool |
| **Monthly** | Consolidated from weekly | Startup catch-up + cron (1st of month 5 AM) + `memory_consolidate` tool |
| **Yearly** | Consolidated from monthly | Startup catch-up + cron (January 1st 5 AM) + `memory_consolidate` tool |
| **Significant** | Permanently remembered events | Created manually |

### Retention Model

All memories are kept permanently across all granularities. Daily memories are never archived or deleted. The consolidation tiers (weekly/monthly/yearly) exist to provide higher-quality distilled summaries for broad queries, while the original daily memories preserve full detail.

SQLite + sqlite-vec scales well for this use case — even a lifetime of daily memories (50 years × 365 days = ~18,000 entries) is trivially small for vector search.

### Storage Layout

```
data/memories/
├── daily/          # YYYY-MM-DD_instance.md (per-instance)
├── weekly/         # YYYY-WNN.md
├── monthly/        # YYYY-MM.md
├── yearly/         # YYYY.md
└── significant/    # YYYY-MM-DD_slug.md
```

## Memory Search & Retrieval

`memory_search` uses per-sentence embedding and multi-signal ranking:

```
finalScore = (vectorScore × 0.8) + (recencyScore × 0.05) + (graphBoost × 0.05) + (instanceScore × 0.1)
```

### Per-Sentence Embedding

The user's message is split into sentences, and each sentence is embedded and searched independently. KNN results are merged (deduplicated, keeping best score per memory). This handles natural conversation where the actual topic is embedded in a longer message alongside pleasantries and context. Capped at 5 sentences.

| Signal | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Vector similarity** | 0.8 | Semantic match via embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, 384 dims) |
| **Recency** | 0.05 | Inverse decay: `1 / (1 + age_days × 0.007)` — half-life ~100 days |
| **Graph boost** | 0.05 | Boosts memories linked to entity nodes matching the query |
| **Instance affinity** | 0.1 | +0.1 for memories from the same embodiment |

### How It Works

1. The query is embedded locally using the same model as Psycheros (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
2. Entity nodes in the knowledge graph matching the query are found (for graph boosting)
3. **Cached embeddings** (preferred): KNN search against pre-computed embeddings stored in `graph.db` via sqlite-vec. Returns top candidates in sub-second time. Embeddings are computed eagerly when memories are created/updated via MCP, and lazily on first search for any uncached memories.
4. **Full scan fallback**: If the embedding cache is empty (e.g., fresh install), all memory files are loaded, embedded, and cached as they go. Each file only needs to be embedded once — subsequent searches use the cached vector.
5. Each candidate memory is scored using the multi-signal formula above
6. Results are sorted by final score and filtered by `minScore`
7. Excerpts are returned: short memories (<2000 chars) in full; longer memories get the most relevant section with surrounding context

### Fallback

If vector search is unavailable (sqlite-vec not loaded, embedding model fails), the system falls back to text-based substring matching with instance boosting. The `method` field in results indicates which search method was used. On first run, the sqlite-vec extension is automatically downloaded from GitHub releases if not found in `lib/`.

### Instance Relevance

Results from the same embodiment are boosted, making memories contextually relevant to the current interface — a memory created in Psycheros is slightly more relevant when searching from Psycheros than from SillyTavern.
